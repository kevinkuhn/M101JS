* Document Database
* JSON to store data
* Dev can design database models to support common data access patterns
* Combining Content without JOINs accross tables possible
* MongoDB can be scaling out to different servers (nodes) without the need of scaling up
* Supports agile development process

### Overview of Building an App with MongoDB

### JSON

* Keys have to be strings
